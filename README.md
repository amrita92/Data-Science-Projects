Analysis new coders by countries from freecodecamp

Project Description:
Which is the best way to advertise a product? Here we analyze an e-learning company freeCodeCamp.

Goal of Analysis:
We’ll analyze existing data about new coders to find the best markets to invest in for advertisting. To make our recommendation, we’ll try to find out:
•	Where are these new coders located.
•	Which locations have the greatest number of new coders.
•	How much money new coders are willing to spend on learning.
Data Collection:
We use the github repository : https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2017-new-coder-survey
1.	2017-new-coder-survey-part-1.csv - the first half of the survey. 100% of respondants completed this section.
2.	2017-new-coder-survey-part-2.csv - the first half of the survey, plus the second half - which about 95% of respondants also completed.
Platform Used:
We use the Jupyter Python Notebook for showing the data visualizations. 
Packages used are:  Pandas and Matplotlib.

How to Approach the problem?
We need to explore what job roles the candidate is interested in? There is a column called JobRoleInterest that describes the role of each coder in interested in. We need a frequency distribution table that categorizes and put these interests in bins.
